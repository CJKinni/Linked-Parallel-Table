[The Linked Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules](http://cjkinni.github.io/linked-parallel-table/)

A simple script to create a version of the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules with links to the legal texts.

In my final semester of law school, I was sitting in an Administrative law class where we were learning about some of the resources used to practice administrative law.  One was the [PARALLEL TABLE OF AUTHORITIES AND RULES](https://www.gpo.gov/help/parallel_table.pdf).  The document links all of the regulatory rules in the United states with a citation to the US Code giving the agency the authority to make the rule.

While we were discussing how to use the document, the instructor mentioned that there wasn't a linked version of the list.  I found [a text version of the list](https://github.com/CJKinni/Linked-Parallel-Table/blob/master/ptoa_2014.txt) and began to write a script that would parse the text and link it to [law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/).  It was a fun project, and by the time the class was over, I had most of the [linked parallel table](cjkinni.com/Linked-Parallel-Table/) finished.

In the subsequent years, Cornell seems to have updated their site with their own version of a [parallel table of authorities](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ptoa).

If you are using my linked parallel table, or would like to have it updated to a more recent year, feel free to reach out at lets talk AT cjkinni dot com.
